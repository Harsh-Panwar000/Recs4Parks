# Recs4Parks
##Inspiration
My partner and I came into this project not knowing much about parks and camping, so we decided to make a website that would help inform us and others about the parks that exist in this country.
## What it does
The website offers a view of all the national parks of the state the user enters in and also offers more detailed insights into each park.
##How we built it
We used Flask to create a web application that used API calls from the National Park Service to get the data for our website.
##Challenges we ran into
Integrating API's into a flask application was something we were both unfamiliar with.
##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to get a good looking website done with API calls within a few hours in software we were not too comfortable with
##What we learned
We learned how to integrate API's into a flask web app
##What's next Recs4Parks
We need to improve and optimize our park finding algorithim to provide better options corresponding to user proximity
